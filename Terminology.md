# Basic Terms

## Cubes
Cubes are your stakes. Winning ranked games will get you cubes, which increases your rank (similarly, losing games will lose you cubes). The number of cubes won and lost in a game depends on the stakes of each game, which changes with the Snap mechanic as well as when the final turn of the game resolves.

## Snap
The mechanic by which players are able to double the stakes of a game. This is done by clicking/tapping the numbered cube at the top-middle of the screen in a game. Snapping can be done once per game per player.

## Retreat
The mechanic by which players can leave a game. This is done by clicking on the retreat button on the bottom left of the screen in a game.

## Priority
A community term used to describe whose cards flip over first in a turn. For an in-depth guide to priority, see [How Priority Works](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220744445050355775).

## Season

The season determines the timeframe in which you can collect rewards for a specific Season Pass and Conquest shop, as well as denoting when the rankings reset and the Conquest tickets and medals are cashed out. For more details, see [How Marvel Snap Changes](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222213221411323954/1222261139992215694).

## Patch
A patch is a change to the Marvel Snap client code. Installing a patch version requires players to update the Marvel Snap application through the respective app store for their device. For more details, see [How Marvel Snap Changes](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222213221411323954/1222261591903305921).

## Over the Air (OTA)
An OTA is a change to the game functionality that does *not* require users to update their Marvel Snap application. On startup, the game checks if there is an OTA update and automatically updates itself. For more details, see [How Marvel Snap Changes](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222213221411323954/1222261790495211671).

# Ranked Terms

## Rank
Your rank is shown by the number to the right of the “Play” button. There are 12 ranks; Recruit (1-4), Agent (5-9), Iron (10-19), Bronze (20-29), Silver (30-39), Gold (40-49), Platinum (50-59), Diamond (60-69), Vibranium (70-79), Omega (80-89), Galactic (90-99), and finally the highest rank Infinite (100). At the end of every season, your rank resets according to the Rank Reset algorithm (see below).

## Infinite
The highest rank in the game. When you reach Infinite, you get access to the post-Infinite rank system, which assigns ranks to players based on a leaderboard (a lower rank number is better at this point) as opposed to the pre-infinite cube-based ranking.

## Rank Reset
At the end of every season your rank resets as follow: 
1. Deduct 30 ranks from player’s last rank in the previous season
2. Round down to the closest integer divisible by 5
3. Add 3 bonus ranks

Rank 10, Iron, is the rank floor and you can not go below it.
No matter how high you rank at Infinite, you will always reset to rank 73.

Example: If you are rank 77, your rank would be reset to 48 (77-30=47, rounded down to 45, +3 to 48)

# Conquest Terms
For more detailed information on Conquest, see [Conquest Mode & Shop](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220824127808606219).

## Tiers
There are four tiers in Conquest: Proving Grounds, Silver, Gold, and Infinity. Each subsequent tier has a higher entry fee and number of battles to complete than the last.

## Tickets
Tickets are the main means to enter Silver, Gold, or Infinity Conquest (Proving Grounds is free to enter). Winning a Conquest tier will reward you with a ticket to enter the next tier (or in the case of Infinite Conquest, an Infinite avatar). If you have no tickets, you can enter by paying gold instead.

## Medals
Medals are a currency earned exclusively in Conquest by winning games; they can be used to buy rewards in the Medal Shop. After buying 9 items in the Medal Shop in one season you get that season’s exclusive Conquest variant.

# Basic Deck Building Terms

## Archetype
An archetype refers to a category, classification, or style of deck. Archetypes are typically pretty broad in definitions (such as Destroy, Bounce, etc) though can be specific in nature in rare cases (such as [Hela](https://snap.fan/cards/Hela/)-style decks).

## Shell
A group of cards that forms the basic structure of a deck; these are typically irreplaceable or difficult-to-replace cards. For example, a “Destroy” shell would include cards like [Venom](https://snap.fan/cards/Venom/) and [Carnage](https://snap.fan/cards/Carnage/), or a “Bounce” shell would include [Beast](https://snap.fan/cards/Beast/) and [Falcon](https://snap.fan/cards/Falcon/).

## Package
A grouping of cards that synergize together that can be slotted into a variety of different shells or archetypes. For example, [Annihilus](https://snap.fan/cards/Annihilus/), [Sentry](https://snap.fan/cards/Sentry/), and [Hood](https://snap.fan/cards/Hood/) form a package that can be used in a Bounce shell or a Black Knight Discard shell.

## Tech Card
A card that is included in a deck to counter or adapt to a specific metagame or protect against a bad matchup. Tech cards do not necessarily contribute to the main goal a deck has. These can be cards that actively disrupt opponents (like [Shang-Chi](https://snap.fan/cards/ShangChi/)) or inclusions to offset an unfavorable metagame (like [Caiera](https://snap.fan/cards/Caiera/) in a Zoo deck when Destroy decks have high presence).

## Metagame (Meta)
In Snap, metagame refers to the presence (play %) of various decks and cards at a point in time. This is commonly brought up when discussing what decks are powerful at any given time as well as what tech cards should be included in a deck to help improve a deck’s win rate.

# Resource Acquisition

## Collection Level (CL)
The Collection Level is the number that represents a player’s collection progression through the game. Upgrading cards in the collection menu increases your collection level, which earns you rewards on the collection track such as cards, cosmetics, currency, boosters, and Spotlight Keys.

## Tokens

## Token Shop
The token shop is a section on the shop page where tokens can be spent. Additionally, the Series 4/5 card and the Ultimate variant rotate every 8 hours and can be pinned to purchase later.

## Series
The acquisition of cards is broken down into the Series system. A player first acquires all of Series 1 cards, followed by all of Series 2 cards. Once they have those, they gain access to Series 3, 4, and 5 cards. Series 3 cards are acquired via the collection track (similar to Series 1/2 cards) as well as via the Token Shop Mystery S3 card for 1000 Tokens. Series 4 and 5 cards can only be gotten via Spotlight Caches or the Token Shop. Series 4 cards cost 3000 Tokens, whereas Series 5 cards cost 6000 tokens. For more information on Series, see [What are Series?](https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221856514952658944).
