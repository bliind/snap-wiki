[Abomination](<https://snap.fan/cards/Abomination/>)
- Gains a [new ability](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881657884414042>) when paired with [High Evolutionary](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881368401678397>).
[Absorbing Man](<https://snap.fan/cards/AbsorbingMan/>)
- Copies the entire text of the last card you played if it has an on reveal ability, meaning he will copy [Electro](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221880081451057213>) and [Space Stone](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893053590016000>)'s on reveal abilities AND Ongoing abilities.
- Cards pulled by [Jubilee](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221883886682767512>), Sakaar, Grand Central, etc. are not played, Absorbing man will copy the card played before those effects triggered.
- Once Absorbing Man gets a different effect, his old one is gone. Meaning that if you play [Odin](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221888369408344224>) or another Absorbing Man, the new effect will be re-triggered/copied.
- Even after copying a different effect, Absorbing Man is still Absorbing Man. copying [Thanos](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892858198364251>) with him won't give him the Power Stone +10 buff, copying [Thor](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893413507436574>) won't give him the Mjolnir +6 buff.
[Adam Warlock](<https://snap.fan/cards/AdamWarlock/>)
- Adam Warlock's effect triggers at the end of the turn. End of the turn effects trigger in play order, meaning:
  if I play [Sunspot](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892548017258517>) on turn one, Adam Warlock on turn 5 and the opponent plays [High Evo Cyclops](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881528255254578>) on turn 6, they will trigger in this order: Sunspot gains power, Adam Warlock draws a card if im winning the lane and Cyclops afflicts two of my cards in that location with -1 power.
- If Adam Warlock is revealed at the end of the game (via Dark Dimension or [Supergiant](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892700958359592>) for example), he won't draw a card, even if you're winning the lane

[Agatha Harkness](<https://snap.fan/cards/AgathaHarkness/>)
- At the start of the game, Agatha adds herself to your hand as a bonus draw and not the first draw like [Quicksilver](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889150731681842>).
- Despite what her text says, Agatha starts in your deck (and is added to hand at the start of the game as mentioned above), meaning she can be copied by [Loki](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221884951725871176>) and [Quinjet](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889306365263883>) won't reduce her cost.
- When Agatha is active in your hand, your turn timer is greatly reduced.
- Agatha plays your cards completely randomly, but she will play herself if she can (to a random location).
- When Ego is one of the locations, he'll take over and play your cards for you even if Agatha is in your hand.
- At the end of the game, Agatha will receive all boosters gained that match.
- Even turns means 2, 4 and 6.
[Agent 13](<https://snap.fan/cards/Agent13/>) 
- Cards created by Agent 13 will reduce [Mockingbird's](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221887047325978674>) cost by 1, trigger [Collector](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893225384771624>)'s ability and the cards' cost will be reduced by [Quinjet](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889306365263883>).
- Agent 13 cannot generate [Kang](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221884045831438426>).
[Agent Coulson](<https://snap.fan/cards/AgentCoulson/>)
- Cards created by Agent Coulson will reduce [Mockingbird's](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221887047325978674>) cost by 1, trigger [Collector](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893225384771624>)'s ability and the cards' cost will be reduced by [Quinjet](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889306365263883>).
- Agent Coulson cannot generate [Kang](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221884045831438426>).
[Alioth](<https://snap.fan/cards/Alioth/>)
- When Alioth hits a trigger card (not Ongoing) that gains power in hand (ex: [Red Hulk](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1225031028440301570>) and [Kitty Pryde](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221884190899961975>)), they will keep any power they already gained from their abilities but won't be able to get additional power from their abilities.
- When Alioth hits a [Mysterio](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221887440046919700>), he'll stop it from "revealing" at the end of the game, but not from playing the additional clones.
 - If Alioth hits the real Mysterio, his power won't go up to 4 at the end of the game.
[America Chavez](<https://snap.fan/cards/AmericaChavez/>)
[Angel](<https://snap.fan/cards/Angel/>)
- When you destroy multiple cards with one effect (ex: [Killmonger](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221884121857392801>)), Angel will jump to the location of the first card that was destroyed.
- If you destroy a card but the board remains full, Angel will stay in deck.
[Angela](<https://snap.fan/cards/Angela/>)
- Angela's effect triggers when you stage a card to her locations as long as it reveals in that location. if you play a card there and it was moved while unrevealed (by [Juggernaut](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221883936607699045>) for example), Angela won't get the buff.
- If the card was staged and revealed at her location but resolved in a different one (ex: [Spider-Man](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892080591437975>), Angela's ability will trigger.
- Angela's effect wont be triggered by cards that were added/moved to her location (ex: [Doctor Doom](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221879809517289563>)'s Doombots and [Nightcrawler](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221888202172928020>)'s movement).
[Annihilus](<https://snap.fan/cards/Annihilus/>)
- When Annihilus' ability triggers, he checks cards' current power. This means if you have an [Iron Man](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221883462995284119>) on Sewer system, Annihilus will send him to the opponents side because his current power is -1. 
- Annihilus switches cards based on reveal order. if I have a lane with: [The Hood](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893260482711656>) and [Sentry](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221890594687942687>)'s Void, The Hood will switch sides first, then The Void will switch.
- Annihilus **can** send himself to the opponents side if his power is lower than 0.
[Ant-Man](<https://snap.fan/cards/AntMan/>)
- Ant-Man's ability will trigger whether he's alone or with any amount of other cards on Space Throne.
[Apocalypse](<https://snap.fan/cards/Apocalypse/>)
- When Apocalypse's ability triggers, it also triggers [The Collector](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221893225384771624>)'s ability.
- When [Dracula](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221879926244773928>) discards apocalypse, Dracula will gain Apocalypse's power *after* he comes back to hand, meaning he will get Apocalypse's +4.
- "When you discard this" effects (ex: [Helicarrier](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881233710256288>) and [Proxima Midnight](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889052324663477>)) go before "When you discard a card effects (ex: [Miek](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886391550607420>) and [Black Knight](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221877346647277609>)).
[Armor](<https://snap.fan/cards/Armor/>)
- Armor's effect protects both revealed and unrevealed cards at her location.
- [Galactus](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221880369079521400>) will destroy any card Armor is protecting, including Armor herself.
- When Armor moves, her effect turns on immediately; not when she resolves.
[Arnim Zola](<https://snap.fan/cards/ArnimZola/>)
- Arnim Zola must destroy a card in order to create copies. If a card is indestructible, he won't be able to copy it.
- Arnim Zola creates two copies, the left copy's ability will activate before the right one's.
- The rightmost copy acts like an unrevealed card (even if its visually revealed), until the leftmost copy resolves.
[Attuma](<https://snap.fan/cards/Attuma/>)
- Attuma looks at both his own and his targets' __**current**__ power.
- Attuma doesn't necessarily destroy the card with the *lowest* power in his lane; he can destroy any card on your side that has less power than him.
- Attuma has an end of the turn effect. End of the turn effects trigger based on play order.
  example: if I play [Sunspot](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892548017258517>) on turn 1, Attuma on turn 4 (with priority) and the opponent plays [High Evo Cyclops](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881528255254578>) on turn 4 (without priority), the effects will trigger in this order:
  Sunspot gains power, Attuma will destroy himself if nothing is stopping him from doing so and Cyclops afflicts two of my cards in that location with -1 power.
- Attuma's effect can be "cancelled" if you make him reveal at the end of the game using Dark Dimension, [Invisible Woman](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221883056282009620>) or [Supergiant](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892700958359592>).
[Baron Mordo](<https://snap.fan/cards/BaronMordo/>)
- If your opponent has a [Mobius](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886921366700185>) in play, he'll ignore Mordo's cost increase; Baron Mordo won't be able to set the card's cost to 6 (unless that card costs more than 6) as long as Mobius' ability is active.
- A friendly Mobius won't stop the affected card's cost from going back down at the end of turn 6.
- Baron Mordo's cost increase turns off at the start of turn 6, not the end of it.
- The affected card's cost can't be reduced before turn 6, when Mordo's effect turns off.
 - [Wave](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221894381418709103>) overrides Mordo's effect and reduces the card's cost to 4 even before turn 6.
[Bast](<https://snap.fan/cards/Bast/>)
- If you have a [Luke Cage](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221885018750849096>) in play, he will stop Bast from decreasing cards' power if their power was higher than 3 before Bast triggered right after you play them (their power will be 3 power as long as they're in hand).
[Beast](<https://snap.fan/cards/Beast/>)
- Beast's ability will not return unrevealed cards to hand.
- Beast will return cards based on their order in the location (top left card first, top right card second, etc.).
- Beast's cost reduction will be blocked by [Mobius](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886921366700185>).
[Beta Ray Bill](<https://snap.fan/cards/BetaRayBill/>)
- When Beta Ray Bill adds [Stormbreaker](<https://snap.fan/cards/Stormbreaker/>) to your deck, your deck is shuffled.
- Stormbreaker's doubles Beta Ray Bill's **permanent** power, meaning it will ignore buffs from cards like [Blue Marvel](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221877646594412635>) and locations like Nidavellir.
- Stormbreaker will buff all available Beta Ray Bills on your side of the board.
[Bishop](<https://snap.fan/cards/Bishop/>)
- Bishop's effect won't be triggered by cards that were added/moved and not played (ex: [Doctor Doom](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221876925795008542>)'s Doombots and [Nightcrawler](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221876925795008542>)'s movement).
[Black Bolt](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackBolt/>)
- If your opponent has a [Morbius](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221887271280578661>) or [Miek](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886391550607420>), Black Bolt will trigger their effects.
- If your opponent's hand has two cards that share the same cost (the lowest cost), Black Bolt will randomly choose one of them.
[Black Cat](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackCat/>)
- If Black Cat is drawn during a turn (via [Crystal](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221878212175597678>) or Asgard for example), Black Cat will be discarded and you won't get a chance to play her.
[Black Knight](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackKnight/>)
- Similar to how he interacts with [Dracula](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221879926244773928>), when [Apocalypse](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221877002269757491>) is discarded, Black Knight will add the [Ebony Blade](<https://snap.fan/cards/EbonyBlade/>) to your hand with the bonus 4 power from Apocalypse's ability.
- If you discard a card with less than 0 power, Ebony Blade's power will remain at 0.
- Ebony Blade's ability isn't active when its unrevealed.
- "When you discard this" effects (ex: [Helicarrier](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221881233710256288>) and [Proxima Midnight](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221889052324663477>)) go before "When you discard a card effects (ex: [Miek](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886391550607420>) and this one).
[Black Panther](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackPanther/>)
- Black Panther's ability doubles his **permanent** power, meaning he will ignore buffs from cards like [Blue Marvel](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220781827229487218/1220782289873670236>) and locations like Nidavellir.
[Black Swan](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackSwan/>) 
- Black Swan's ability reduces cards with 1 **base** cost, not current cost. so if a two cost card was reduced to 1 by Elysium, Black Swan won't reduce it to 0, but if a one cost card was increased by [Iceman](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221882797229084672>) for example, Black Swan will still reduce it to 0.
- Black Swan's cost reduction will be blocked by [Mobius](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221886921366700185>).
[Black Widow](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlackWidow/>)
- [Widow's Bite](<https://snap.fan/cards/WidowsBite/>) will stop the opponent from drawing cards, no matter what. that includes: [Infinity Stones](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221892858198364251>), locations and cards like [Crystal](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221878212175597678>).
[Blade](<https://snap.fan/cards/Blade/>)
[Blob](<https://snap.fan/cards/Blob/>)
- Blob stops merging cards after he gains 13 power from his ability. if he gained 12 power then merged a 3 power card, he'll go to 15 and stop for example. 
- If Blobs ability is re-triggered by a location like Kamar-taj or a card like [Wong](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1221858388401717279/1221894808931668029>), he'll be able to gain 13+ power again.
[Blue Marvel](<https://snap.fan/cards/BlueMarvel/>)
[Brood](<https://snap.fan/cards/Brood/>)
- When Brood creates the two [Broodlings](<https://snap.fan/cards/Broodling/>), they copy his permanent power, meaning Ongoing buffs don't count. They'll still get the Ongoing buff after resolving (if they're supposed to); this line is here in case a future card or location somehow only buffs Brood but not Broodlings with its Ongoing ability.

- If Rescue is played and bounced on the same turn (via Luke's Bar for example), her ability won't work the following turn.
