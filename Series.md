# Series

Series (sometimes called pools) refers to a group of select cards obtainable for a certain range of your [Collector Level](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222016131754229893/1222017229227556884>). These are the primary "ranges" of acquisition, as in, these are the cards you are eligible to unlock at certain collector levels.

## Starter Cards
These are the first 13 cards given to everyone when they start the game! Every player is guaranteed to unlock this set of cards at the beginning of the game, before you unlock the Recruit Season or the [Collector Level](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222016131754229893/1222017229227556884>) Reward Track.

*Something To Note*
In-game, these cards are labeled as “Series 1”, but due to the mannerism in which Series 1 cards are typically acquired, these fit a separate category.

## Recruit Season
Widely regarded as the beginner “season”, the Recruit Season will be your first experience collecting cards in Marvel Snap. This is the first season you will play through before you get to the current ongoing seasons. The Recruit Season contains 5 cards in it, that you are guaranteed to unlock for free.

*Something To Note*
In-game, these cards are labeled as “Series 1”, but due to the mannerism in which Series 1 cards are typically acquired, these fit a separate category.

## Series 1
The first true collectable pool in the game, Series 1 ranges from [Collector Level](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222016131754229893/1222017229227556884>) 1 to [Collector Level](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1222016131754229893/1222017229227556884>) 202. These cards can be collected in two ways, through mystery cards or guaranteed cards from the collection level track, within the range of collector level stated earlier. The guaranteed cards appear first in the track, and then you will unlock the Series 1 cards exclusively through mystery cards.

## Series 3
Series 3 contains the bulk of obtainable cards. These are most commonly available through 3 methods, and although there are other ways to access them, I will only be speaking on these 3.

1. Collector Level Track
Series 3 Cards are Obtainable in Collector’s Caches and Collector’s Reserves. The exact rates can be found here: https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220884583088918528

2. Free Claim
Once per season, you will be able to claim a series 3 card in the shop section of the game for free! This free slot rotates every 8 hours, so make sure to check it, and choose wisely! You only get one claim per season, and these claims **do NOT** accumulate (stack) over time.

3. Token Shop
There is a Token Shop offering of 1 random Series 3 card for 1000 Tokens. Elaborating much on this is not needed, as we **strongly** suggest that you **do NOT** buy this offering.

All Series 3 Cards can be found **[here](<https://snap.fan/cards/series/Series3/>)**

## Series 4
This is the first collectable pool unable to be acquired from the Collector Level Track. These cards are obtainable in the [**Token Shop**](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220491822971752519>) for 3000 Tokens, and mainly through [**Spotlight Keys**](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220491370272133181>). These cards are also subject to **Series Drops**, an infrequent event in which cards can "drop" series, from Series 5 to Series 4, or Series 4 to Series 3. 

All Series 4 Cards can be found **[here](<https://snap.fan/cards/series/Series4/>)**

## Series 5
Series 5 cards are separated into two categories, Traditional Series 5 Cards, and “Big Bads”. Both will be discussed below.

1. Traditional Series 5 Cards
Series 5 Cards are unable to be acquired from the Collector Level Track. These cards are obtainable in the [**Token Shop**](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220491822971752519>) for 6000 Tokens, and mainly through [**Spotlight Keys**](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1220491370272133181>). These cards are also subject to **Series Drops** (see Series 4 above). Most new cards are released into Series 5.

2. Big Bads
These cards follow all the same rules as traditional series 5 cards, except that they are not subject to **Series Drops**. They are **permanent** Series 5 Cards.

All Series 5 Cards can be found **[here](<https://snap.fan/cards/series/Series5/>)**

*Note __High Evolutionary, Kang, Galactus, and Thanos__ are **Big Bads**. SD also have no [plans](<https://discord.com/channels/978545345715908668/1212148787779473468>) to release more Big Bads at this time.*

## Season Pass
Season Pass cards are obtainable during their release season for $9.99 USD (or local currency equivalent). They are not obtainable by any other means during this period. After the season ends, the Season Pass card will drop directly to Series 5, and follow all the rules of Traditional Series 5 Cards (see above).
